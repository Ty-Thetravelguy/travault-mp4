# Travault: A Tailored CRM for Travel Management Companies

## Project Overview

Travault is a data warehouse solution designed for smaller travel management companies (TMCs). Based on my three years of experience working for a boutique TMC, I've identified a gap in the market for affordable, feature-rich Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems. While popular CRMs like HubSpot and Salesforce offer powerful tools, their costs can be prohibitive for smaller companies, and free versions often have significant limitations. Travault aims to provide a tailored, cost-effective alternative with enhanced functionality compared to free CRM versions.
